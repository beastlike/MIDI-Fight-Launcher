This is a Ableton Live MIDI sript made fro the MF Pro to mimic some basic behavior of the Launchpad. Like launching clips, arming, muting tracks, etc.
The mapping consits of 4 pages.
Page 1: is the General control page and consists of tempo controls, global play, stop and record and the controls to move around the "red box"
Page 2: is the Track control page. Each row corresponds to one of the rows inside of the red box. And it consits of Track select, Mut, Arm and Solo.
Page 3: is the Clip control page, you have a 4x3 grid and the top row is the stop button for each track.
Page 4: is the drum rack pad. It plays the highlighted 4x4 grid in the drum rack. Make sure that the drum track is Armed and the Track input is On in the
Midi preferences page.

Also the knobs and faders get automatically mapped to the first effect device of the selected track.
